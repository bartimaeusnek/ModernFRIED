## ModernFRIED
Farbrausch's FRIED Library adjusted to compile to modern x64.  
This repository also includes a C# wrapper, so it can be used with .NET8  

## Changes made:  
- Custom ASM replaced with C/C++ code
- FileHeader adjusted (replaced int32 with int8 in some places to shorten the file size)
- replaced custom alias types in code with cstdint types (e.g. sS16 -> int16_t, sU8 -> uint8_t, etc.)
- added a command line tool to fry/unfry images
- added a simple roundtrip test
